# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for work, academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks, and Matlab files.

_Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only._


## Contents

- ### Main Projects

	<!-- - [Failures of non-repairable equipment](https://github.com/josedavid2101/Predictive_maintenance): A model to predict the expected life of non-repairable equipment using various statistical analysis tools. Using historical data to fit the model resulted in decreasing equipment maintenance expenses. -->
	- [Images Sybthesis using diffusion Generative Model](https://github.com/josedavid2101/Image_Synthesis_Diffusion_Model): Developed and implemented a Diffusive model to generate materials micrsotructure images. Using Pytorch, generated images are used to study materials design, improving materials simulations cost by 92%.
	- [Solar Batery optimization](https://github.com/josedavid2101/Optimization_techniques): Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000, to identify likely donors for a fictional non-profit organisation.
	- [Materials Design Video game Hypothesis testing](https://github.com/josedavid2101/Statistics_videogame/blob/main/README.md): In this project, I use a Materials Science video game to collect data to help build a model to perform Materials design. I tested different game modes (computer-only, human-only, and hybrid), and hypothesis testing was used to determine the most efficient way to generate good results..
	- [Supply chain consulting project](https://github.com/josedavid2101/Supply_Chain_Data_Analysis): Data analysis project working as a consultant. Data of daily orders of different clients was analyzed to make data-driven decisions on what machines to buy to fulfill daily orders optimally.
	- [A/B testing](https://github.com/josedavid2101/AB_testing_Case_Study): Implementation of an A/B test analysis to help a business make a data-driven decision that increased profits by 2% using real-world data.

	_Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pygame_ 


- ### Micro projects
	- [Linear regression](https://github.com/sajal2692/Scalable-Walkability-Analysis-of-Melbourne): Analysis of walkability of suburbs in Melbourne, Victoria and its implications.
	- [Monte Carlo simulation to optimize Rastrigin function](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/Titanic%20Dataset%20-%20Exploratory%20Analysis.ipynb): Exploratory Analysis of the passengers onboard RMS Titanic using Pandas and Seaborn visualisations.
	- [Gradient descent & quasi-Newton method to optimize Rosenbrock's function](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/Stock%20Market%20Analysis%20for%20Tech%20Stocks.ipynb): Analysis of technology stocks including change in price over time, daily returns, and stock behaviour prediction.
		<!-- - [Desicion tree, random forest, xbost](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/2016%20General%20Election%20Poll%20Analysis.ipynb): Very simple analysis of 2016 US General Election Poll data.
		- [Deep learning project](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/911%20Calls%20-%20Exploratory%20Analysis.ipynb): Exploratory Data Analysis of the 911 calls dataset hosted on Kaggle. Demonstrates extraction of useful features from different variables. -->
		
	_Tools: Pandas, Folium, Seaborn and Matplotlib_
