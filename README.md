<h1 align="center"> Main Projects</h1>

- ## Images Synthesis using diffusion Generative Model

	<!-- - [Failures of non-repairable equipment](https://github.com/josedavid2101/Predictive_maintenance): A model to predict the expected life of non-repairable equipment using various statistical analysis tools. Using historical data to fit the model resulted in decreasing equipment maintenance expenses. -->

**[Images Synthesis using diffusion Generative Model](https://github.com/josedavid2101/Image_Synthesis_Diffusion_Model): Developed and implemented a Diffusive model to generate materials micrsotructure images. Using Pytorch, generated images are used to study materials design, improving materials simulations cost by 92%.

- ## Solar Batery optimization

	- [Solar Batery optimization](https://github.com/josedavid2101/Optimization_techniques): Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000, to identify likely donors for a fictional non-profit organisation.

- ## Materials Design Video game Hypothesis testing

	- [Materials Design Video game Hypothesis testing](https://github.com/josedavid2101/Statistics_videogame/blob/main/README.md): In this project, I use a Materials Science video game to collect data to help build a model to perform Materials design. I tested different game modes (computer-only, human-only, and hybrid), and hypothesis testing was used to determine the most efficient way to generate good results..

- ## Supply chain consulting project

	- [Supply chain consulting project](https://github.com/josedavid2101/Supply_Chain_Data_Analysis): Data analysis project working as a consultant. Data of daily orders of different clients was analyzed to make data-driven decisions on what machines to buy to fulfill daily orders optimally.

- ## A/B testing

	- [A/B testing](https://github.com/josedavid2101/AB_testing_Case_Study): Implementation of an A/B test analysis to help a business make a data-driven decision that increased profits by 2% using real-world data.

	_Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pygame_
