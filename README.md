# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for work, academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks, and Matlab files.

_Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only._


## Contents

- ### Projects

	- [Failures of non-repairable equipment](https://github.com/josedavid2101/Predictive_maintenance): A model to predict the expected life of non-repairable equipment using various statistical analysis tools. Using historical data to fit the model resulted in decreasing equipment maintenance expenses.
	- [Solar Batery optimization](https://github.com/josedavid2101/Optimization_techniques): Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000, to identify likely donors for a fictional non-profit organisation.
	- [Materials Design Video game Hypothesis testing](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/customer_segments/customer_segments.ipynb): Analyzing a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories for discovering internal structure, patterns and knowledge.
	- [Supply chain consulting project](https://github.com/sajal2692/Training-a-Smartcab-to-Drive): Creating an optimized Q-Learning driving agent that will navigate a Smartcab through its environment towards a goal.
	- [A/B testing](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/digit_recognition-mnist-sequence.ipynb):  Designing and implementing a Convolutional Neural Network that learns to recognize sequences of digits using synthetic data generated by concatenating images from MNIST.

	_Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pygame_
