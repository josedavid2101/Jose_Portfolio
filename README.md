# Main Projects

- ## [Advanced diffusion model for image generation and materials design](https://github.com/josedavid2101/Image_Synthesis_Diffusion_Model/blob/main/README.md)

Left Image: "A photo of a dog with a backpack riding a bike. It is wearing sunglasses and a hat"

Right image: "Image of the internal structure of a metal (nickel)"

Both images were generated using state-of-the-art diffusion models. In this project, I implemented a diffusion model using Pytorch to generate images of the internal structure of different materials (like the right image!). These images are used to study materials design, reducing materials simulation costs by 92%.

- ## [Solar cell battery optimization](https://github.com/josedavid2101/Optimization_techniques)

<img align="left" width="270" height="170" src="https://github.com/josedavid2101/Jose_Portfolio/blob/main/Images/solar_battery.jpg"> 

An optimal lithium-sulfur battery design for solar cell, drone, and cellphone applications is presented. The optimization improved the initial design by 146.93 Wh/L for the volumetric energy density case. For energy cost, it decreased total cost by 9.4% (731.36 $/kWh). For the solar cell application, optimal design values for cathode, separator, and anode thicknesses are 64.91 µm, 757.26 µm, and 51.92 µm, respectively.

- ## [Materials Design Video game Hypothesis testing](https://github.com/josedavid2101/Statistics_videogame/blob/main/README.md)

<img align="left" width="270" height="170" src="https://github.com/josedavid2101/Jose_Portfolio/blob/main/Images/materials_videogame.jpg"> 

In this project, I used a Materials Science video game to collect data to help build a model to perform Materials design. I tested different game modes, and hypothesis testing was used to determine the most efficient way to generate good results. As a result of our testing, we found that humans are more efficient than the currently used computer algorithms but cannot find as good solutions as computers can. This innovative approach underscores the potential for unconventional data collection methodologies and explores the intersection of human ingenuity and computational prowess in the field of materials science.

- ## [Supply chain consulting project](https://github.com/josedavid2101/Supply_Chain_Data_Analysis)

<img align="left" width="270" height="170" src="https://github.com/josedavid2101/Jose_Portfolio/blob/main/Images/total_cost.jpg">

Real-world data of daily orders from different company clients were analyzed to make data-driven decisions on what machines to buy to fulfill daily orders optimally. After analyzing the data, the recommended approach decreases the production cost by 21% and reduces the downtime by 15%.

- ## [Business decision with A/B test](https://github.com/josedavid2101/AB_testing_Case_Study)

<img align="left" width="270" height="170" src="https://github.com/josedavid2101/Jose_Portfolio/blob/main/Images/AB_test.jpg"> 
<br>
Implementation of an A/B test analysis to help a business make a data-driven decision. Sales data from a retail company is analyzed, and an experiment is designed to determine if proposed changes will increase profits. The results show that the proposed change increases the profits by 2.3%.
