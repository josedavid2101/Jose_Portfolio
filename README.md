# Main Projects

- ## [Images Synthesis using diffusion Generative Model](https://github.com/josedavid2101/Image_Synthesis_Diffusion_Model)

<br>
Developed and implemented a Diffusive model to generate materials micrsotructure images. Using Pytorch, generated images are used to study materials design, improving materials simulations cost by 92%.

- ## [Materials Design Video game Hypothesis testing](https://github.com/josedavid2101/Statistics_videogame/blob/main/README.md)

<img align="left" width="270" height="170" src="https://github.com/josedavid2101/Jose_Portfolio/blob/main/Images/generated_mic.png"> 
<br>
In this project, I use a Materials Science video game to collect data to help build a model to perform Materials design. I tested different game modes (computer-only, human-only, and hybrid), and hypothesis testing was used to determine the most efficient way to generate good results.
